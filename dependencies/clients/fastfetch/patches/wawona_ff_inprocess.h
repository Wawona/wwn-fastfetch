/*
 * App Store-safe in-process execution shim (Apple mobile only).
 *
 * On iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/watchOS/visionOS, fastfetch runs in-process on the zsh
 * pthread inside the Wawona app (see wawona-dispatch.c) rather than via
 * fork/exec. fastfetch calls exit() on --help/--version/bad flags/parse errors;
 * in-process that would terminate the whole app. This shim redirects exit() to
 * a longjmp back to the dispatcher so the shell prompt is restored instead.
 *
 * The exit() redirect is installed as a macro by patch-fastfetch-apple-mobile.py
 * (injected into src/fastfetch.h under WAWONA_APPLE_MOBILE). stdlib.h is included
 * here first so the real libc declaration is not rewritten by the macro.
